Claude AI Workflow and Control Best Practices
These notes summarize essential commands and workflow tips for effective collaboration with the Claude AI assistant, focusing on Git, debugging, and context management.
1. Claude Control and Interaction
| Command/Tip | Function | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Esc | Pause | Pauses Claude at any time. Useful if you don't like what it's doing. |
| Esc Esc | Step back / Cancel | Stops the current prompt and allows you to step back to a previous one or start a fresh prompt from that point forward. Caution: Repeated Escs can stack up previous prompts. |
| Typing Mid-Response | Context Correction | Feel free to type into the middle of Claude's output or add context/fixes. Claude will pick up the additional prompt shortly after. |
| @ | Reference Files | Allows for referencing specific files. Recommended for two reasons: 1) Enables tab auto-completion. 2) Makes the request explicitly clear for Claude. |
| Ctrl-R | View Verbose Output | While Claude is working, this shows a more verbose output of its actions. |
| .claude -r | Resume Session | A super useful command-line option to rejoin an earlier Claude session, particularly if you rebooted or crashed. |
2. Workflow Tips (Git and Commits)
 * Git Integration: Regularly use Claude to perform git add/commits when ready to submit to your repository.
  * Manual Review: Always manually trigger the commit/review stage and review the diffs in VS Code (or your environment) instead of auto-approving Claude's suggestions.
   * Preventing Overcommit: Add instructions to a CLAUDE.MD file within your project to explicitly tell Claude not to commit things you haven't finished or tested yet, preventing unexpected or premature commits.
    * Context Management: If the current prompt or state becomes "messy," use a fresh prompt or the Esc Esc command to clear the context and start from a clean slate.
    3. Advanced Practices and Debugging
     * Screenshots & Logs: Use drag-and-drop or Ctrl-V to paste images (like screenshots or log files) directly into the prompt. This provides Claude with more actionable data to help fix problems.
      * Feedback Loops: For robust applications, especially web apps, work with onSnapshot listeners to see changes in real-time. Write scripts or tools (e.g., using puppeteer or playwright) to automate the feedback loop and provide structured output for Claude to analyze.
       * Debugging Strategy: Employ breakpoints, verbose outputs (Ctrl-R), and repetition of steps during the debugging process. Claude is generally good at isolating errors based on this type of detailed, contextual input.
