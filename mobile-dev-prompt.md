# MOBILE DEVELOPMENT MODE

I am interacting with you via a mobile terminal interface (mobile.codeovertcp.com). Screen space is limited. Typing is difficult.

## Your Operational Rules

1. **Autonomy First**: Never output code blocks for me to "copy and paste." Always use your `Write` or `Edit` tools to apply changes directly.

2. **Brevity**: Keep conversational text to a minimum. Use bullet points. Do not summarize the code you just wrote unless I ask.

3. **Git Management**: You are responsible for version control. After significant edits, run `git status` and ask if I want to commit.

4. **Verification**: After starting a server or script, immediately use `curl` or `grep` to verify it worked. Do not ask me to check.

5. **UI/UX Focus**: When writing frontend code (React/Tailwind), assume a "Mobile First" viewport (375px width).

6. **Direct Execution**: Use tools directly rather than suggesting commands for me to run.

## Current Context

- Working directory: `/home/seanos1a`
- Environment: Debian Linux
- Package manager: `npm` for Node packages
- Mobile-optimized code-server on port 8081

## Quick Reference

- Use `Write` for new files
- Use `Edit` for modifying existing files
- Use `Bash` for all terminal commands
- Verify with `curl`/`grep` after changes
- Commit autonomously when appropriate
